[Music]
were roman houses really dank stuffy and
hot all the time
or do they have air conditioning
what about an attached garage for the
carts and wagons
how big were their front yards and
backyards too
do they all have a great pull about a
hot tub
these and other questions will be
answered right after this
[Music]
ah
[Music]
i'm professor jerome markenberg and i've
been teaching a wide variety of history
courses at colleges across this country
for the past 30 years
in this video i'm going to tell you
about
the roman domis or house
who lived in the single family domi
which is the plural of domes
how these
domi were laid out
and the various rooms in a roman domis
their name
and function
at the end i'll have the wrap-up quote
on this video but first
make sure to click like share
especially subscribe
and that little bell thingy
so continue to bring you more great
videos
just like this one
a single family house or domus or domi
as i said which is the plural
were actually quite rare in roman towns
were largely reserved for the very
wealthy upper classes
let me see depictions cut away
depictions of them here
the romans liked the greeks built
courtyard
domi
or it largely reserved them for sites
devoid of insuli
the roman apartment house
or one's neighbors would be either
another domus
or your house occupied the entire block
let me see it here for example the villa
boscoriale in pompeii
and the villa of the papyri in
pompeii
which was the model for the j paul getty
museum in malibu california
this was for privacy reasons
as if your domus shared a party wall
with an insula
for example here the house of cecilius
yucundis
in an insuli block that's his house
right here and the rest of it is shared
by other insulin
if you shared this part of wealth
peninsula the tenants in the latter
because the insulin were four or five
maybe six stories high
could too easily look down and into your
house or at least your courtyard and see
pretty much everything
[Music]
where your domus did share a party wall
with one or more insulin
the romans adopted the sky whale model
somewhat similar to the greek herdrom
style
where the courtyards were either
significantly cut down so they could be
more easily roofed over or eliminated
entirely
in favor of an atrium
with a small sky well in the roof
in other words a roof opening still
being required for proper cooling and
ventilation
with an impluvium or pull
to collect and store rain water directly
below the sky well so for example here
is the sky well it's this part up here
this would have been the impluvium the
rest is all roofed over and again the
imploving skywell
same thing a little tiny skywall right
here
same thing here
so
with your skywell house your insulin
dwelling neighbors could rarely see
inside your domus
as the only opening was a small sky well
which you see here awesome i just made
it a bit too dark
and any interior visible even from that
tended to be dark as i said
due to the lack of sunlight penetrating
the house from it ingenious
even if it did cut down the light
available to the inside
though the height of the insuli
tended to do that to your domus anyway
[Music]
otherwise the domain followed a
peristyle plant
making it a bit of a fusion between the
peristyle
and the herdrum style
of the greek house
often with two courtyards or perhaps two
skywells as the case may be as you see
in these pictures here and these floor
plans
either are both what collinated walkways
around them
[Music]
unlike greek houses
where the entrance was often if not
usually
big enough to drive a cart and team
through it
the entrance into a roman house
considering any courtyard or sky whale
the atrium was not a kind of farm-like
working area
is more the typical house door of today
with locks
except
and you see it here and accurately done
that
these doors
uniformly swung outwards
not inwards as the modern european
american house does
so the doors would swing outwards and
guarded by a slave usually some big
burly muscular slave
and often not really any door knock
you'd come by and
sort of smack it with your foot well you
don't kick it
you're not trying to smash it in you
sort of knock on it
it would be easier to knock it out with
your hand but instead they use their
feet
once past the door let in by the
guardian slave
you would find yourself in an entrance
hall or
vestibulum let me see the vestibulum
here
these would lead directly into the focal
point of the house
the atrium
as i said
unlike the greek house the roman house
did not have an andron
a room where solely the men of the house
could meet talk dine and party with men
not part of the family
where the only woman allowed would have
been dancers entertainers or prostitutes
and not the women of the family
largely because rome is described
elsewhere in another video
was not nearly as patriarchal
as greece they were patriarchal but not
nearly as bad
and skywell style domi the atrium again
shown here
various depictions
was a location of the important skywell
which allowed existing sunlight into the
house
while also allowing hot air from the
rooms around it to escape upward via the
sky well
the atrium also as mentioned had an
impluvium
or water pool
usually built of marble
directly below the sky whale
where rain water could collect winter
rain instead of flooding the entire
house
you see this in this very nice depiction
here
of course the sky well here's your
improving enemy you see the rain coming
down
and again here is this reconstruction
this case this is a bit shallow here
uh here is a bit probably a bit more
like it
uh
this served primarily as a water
reservoir for the family it was not
meant as maybe shown here
as a bathing or swimming pool or even a
hot tub
which is not to say that children or
that occasional adult never took a dip
in it
but it's primarily a water reservoir
the impluvium also served to humidify
the domus
important especially in the hot dry
summer months
well of course as i mentioned
in time of drought the collected water
would come in mighty handy
again these
impluviums would not be terribly shallow
they may be anywhere from 12 to 18 feet
deep
to collect as much water as possible
[Music]
the atrium is also where the family had
its lorarium
it's altered to the family gods and its
lares and panates more on that in
another video
and here the head of the family would
make daily sacrifice
libation and prayer
this is the lorarium
here you see it again here in this one
and this one hard to see but it's this
thing right here
connected to the atrium directly or by
passageways which the romans called
falcay's
fouchy in modern italian would be all
the other rooms of the house
so bedrooms as you see here
or cubiculi
singular being cubiculum
where a host might also entertain
business associates
though
if a domus had as it often did a second
story the kabukilai would be located in
the second floor
and strange men would not be let up
there
an office or tablinum
for the owner of the house again you see
it here
usually located directly opposite the
main entrance
with its back opening directly onto the
rear peristylium which again you can see
here's the rear pedestrian here here
here and here
uh often this was
the only way through the temple in them
into the rear of the house
a bit of a guard you might say in the
rest of the house
a dining room or a triclinium again
shown here with normally three couches
two people to a couch
set up on which to recline and eat and
they were slightly tilted
away from the food table which is not
shown here but is very nicely shown here
notice they are slightly tilted away
these would have been arranged around a
load table here here or here
you can maybe see it here
on which the food would be placed not
wine
that was held and served by a waiting
slave
to force her open side this part here
here and here
would be facing the entrance of the room
to allow easy food service by slaves
coming from the kitchen
though during the time of the republic
women did not recline on couches
but set up right in chairs
the only woman who would have reclined
in a couch
next to a man during the republic
would have been a prostitute
many domini
contain more than one triclinium
psoas and retain very many guests
including in the homes the very very
wealthy
perhaps one large enough to see 20
people in other words 10 couches
plus perhaps smaller ones for more
intimate or family-only dining
again you see it very nicely here
how the couch is
tilted with the entertainers this one is
a bit outside
and again you can see men and women
reclining together
back of the domus off the atrium was
another courtyard
the peristylium
or perhaps another atrium with a sky
whale if the dome is shared a party wall
with insulin
again normally colonated as you see here
with bushes flowers herbal plants
remember unlike the greek courtyard
which did not want any plants or trees
bushes flowers in it the romans thought
of it differently
around this back courtyard or atrium
would be more rooms
perhaps a dedicated altar to a
significant god
bathing rooms
the kitchen or kulina
and a covered if open-air triclinium
used for dining in the open during the
hot summer
in an effort to maybe catch a breeze or
two
[Music]
the kitchen or culina as you see here
was usually cut off from the light of
the atrium or peristylium
and so was normally a bit too dark
also poorly ventilated
which was okay because the roman mine
this is where the slaves worked and who
cares
now unlike greek houses where cooking
was done over a central hearth
the romans had a masonry stove
which is what you see here this would
have been sort of the stove
also depicted in this reconstruction
here
about table height where in charcoals or
wood
if you want that smoky flavor
could be placed and lit
heating the entire thing
and pots suspended from tripods hanging
over it or just simply chains as shown
here
and you would raise and lower the pots
to regulate the cooking temperature
and gritter ons which is kind of shown
here
for pants
metal grills or craticula
could be placed directly on this stove
or over an open flame for grilling meat
fish fowl or vegetables
while roasting was done on spits
over open fires
turned repetitively by slaves
truly thankless job
again this is where the cooking would
have been done here again here seems to
have
burned the wall a bit now this one is a
bit interesting
see that all this is the workstation and
where everything is cooked
this thing right here
is the put is the toilet
the latrine
you just hike up your sheet hike up or
tuna can just go
and into a large pit which would be
cleared out once or twice a year
unlike the greeks you use the kind of
earthenware dutch oven you might call it
for baking directly on a hearth
the romans used the near eastern beehive
oven
which you see here
made of clay and tiles with an opening
in front for ventilation
now charcoal or wood would be placed
inside
uh normally it actually is not placed
here it's actually placed directly here
as it's shown here and directly in here
and then once it is fully heated and
this area is all super hot
uh the ashes would be raked out which is
what he's doing here
and then you could put bread or whatever
you want to bake place inside
kind of like a modern pizza oven
and then you would shut the door here
shut the front entrance to keep the heat
in
[Music]
there were no separate slave quarters
as slaves normally slept outside their
masters doors at night
to be available to serve them give me a
drink of water give me some wine
whatever
uh but also to protect
everybody wants to gain entrance to the
room
they're gonna have to walk over the
sleeping slave
and hopefully he'd make it a rather
burly big slave so it'd be more likely
to trip so the slave at your front door
your front your bedroom door you might
say it's kind of a burglar and smoke
alarm in one
i do feel sorry for the slave who just
has to sleep on the floor
there were also normally shops not
connected to the living area
facing the street
though this is more common in insula
but even in a regular domes it wasn't
unknown
uh which would bring in some rental
income for the owners
the wrap-up quote
i built this house as you know it was a
shack now it's a temple
it has four count it four dining rooms
20 bedrooms
two marble colonnades an upstairs dining
room
a bedroom in which i sleep a suite of
rooms for this viper here
a really nice cubicle for the doorman
and many guest rooms
